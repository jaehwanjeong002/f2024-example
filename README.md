# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I am thinking of making a game. Among the options provided on Canvas, it will be either Mario or Pong. However, it doesn't mean I confirmed the idea. I am also open with other options or new ideas beside the options provided. I will try to get a group, manage the ideas, and end up confirming the idea, which will be asked for approval to Prof. Rosen.   


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I am planning to have some teammates in a near future. I do not have anyone yet. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?
Not at the moment

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

'Pye Mario Track', possibly change 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

We are planning to make a spinoff of the Super Mario Brothers(similar to Google Dinosaur game) and will add on to the "Mario track" with some graphics and printing texts.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will work as a group with two other classmates, and we are going to create a game based on Super Mario Brothers(similar to Google Dinosaur game). We are going to make a software which will be a side-scrolling platform game, where the player moves to the right to touch the flagpole for winning each stage. In game, there will be a main character who will jump and dodge the obstacles. The obstacles will be upgraded every stage to challeng the players. The storyline will be added and presented in text form.  

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Rameen Abid
- rameen.abid@temple.edu
- Xinwen (Ellen) Zhang

Valeria Albarouki
- valeria.albarouki@temple.edu
- Xinwen (Ellen) Zhang

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- Background graphics
- Character for players
- Storyline with Text
- Challenging obstacles every stage
- The goal flag for next stage or end game

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Background Music Track
- Reasonable number of levels
- Quality graphics

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Items for player
- High Quality Graphics
- Adding monsters to dodge for more challenges

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to learn how to use the LUA language, which is used for progamming Mario Track, and this project will require better Python coding skills to make the game more professional. I also have to find the way to add background music and some sound effect, which is essential to grab more interests and attentions of the player. I also need to improve my creative thinking for make diverse obstacles, so the player can challenge ambitiously.
